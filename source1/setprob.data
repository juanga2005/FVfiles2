 1          read wind data from file? (0 = no, 1 = yes)	
 4320       number of wind data elements
 1	     use vertical wind profile correction? (0 = no, 1 = power law, 2 = logarithmic)
 2           u_cutoff cut off height of velocity profile
 -0.0027      settling velocity (should be negative so particles are falling)
 0.3    vertical wind correction coefficient (does not affect solution when using const wind)
 0.3       alphax
 0.3       alphay
 0.07        alphaz
 1	    k_zz_option	use vertical eddy diffusivity corrections? (0 = no, 1 = yes)
 0.05	    z_0 parameter for k_zz corrections
 2 	    z_low lower layer of variable k_zz (meters)
 -10	    diffL parameter for k_zz corrections (very large values correspond to neutral atmos. class)
 2	    xlower boundary for diff (choice of robin give homog. Neumann)
 2    	    xupper boundary for diff (no robin BC)
 2  	    ylower boundary for diff (choice of robin give homog. Neumann)

 3  	    zlower boundary for diff (robin BC only supported here)
 2	    zupper boundary for diff (no robin BC)
 -0.005     w_deposition ground deposition coefficient (should be negative so flux is going out of domain)
